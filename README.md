# Rails Capstone: Lifestyle Articles
> This repo holds the ruby on rails capstone project inspired by microverse.org & [creativecommons](https://www.behance.net/gallery/14554909/liFEsTlye-Mobile-version).

Capstone projects are solo projects at the end of each of the Microverse Main Technical Curriculum sections. They are meant to give the author the knowledge & real-world working experience through the business specifications which are included in the project requirements. The capstone project is a way of assessing the author's abilities to work with technologies that they acquired under a certain section of the Main Technical Curriculum ( Ruby on Rails in this case ).

This application is based on lifestyle articles website. I developed it following the [creativecommons](https://www.behance.net/gallery/14554909/liFEsTlye-Mobile-version) design. The main goal was to come up with an application that looks as the one in the design. As an optional requirement, I personalized the content to build an application ( Siblife ) which is a site where consumers can post, vote & read on articles. The app is a desktop application, it does not resize perfectly on small screens. Users can create accounts to vote & write articles or readmore about a certain article.

To sign up, users are required to use their name, which they will also use for signing in. It's not in the requirements of the project, but I had to add more fields on the signup/signin pages for better presentation & style. To view the app, visit the link below under the Live Demo section & play with it.

To set up the project on your local machine, follow the instructions below. Please give a start if you like the project.

## Built With

- Sass (.scss)

# Image storage:
As for images, I configured my development, test, & production environment to use [cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/). You can follow [this tutorial](https://hackernoon.com/image-storage-in-rails-apps-using-cloudinary-and-active-storage-9w2u3yli) written by [@brana](https://hackernoon.com/u/bruna) on how you can configure your environments to use cloudinary storage for storing your images. It's free.
